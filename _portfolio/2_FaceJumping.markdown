<br>
As a technical artist at <a href="https://tenderclaws.com">Tender Claws</a>, I designed and created narrative beats for this eye tracking experience.<br>
This included modeling, rigging, animating, and implementing interactive characters, environments, and VFX. I was also responsible for scripting the initial prototype and visuals of the main eye tracking mechanic. One particular scene I owned was the ghost subway scene; in addition to creating all visuals, I wrote a train system with the ability to call the train to the platform, infinitely loop the train, and depart the train into the dark tunnels. Another defining feature of this sequence is a bullet time effect at the moment the player jumps from platform to train, that I scripted to interact with everything else in scene.

Released March 2025.
