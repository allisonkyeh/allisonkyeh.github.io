Hello! My name is Allison Yeh. I am currently a lead artist and technical artist at Fractal Labs, with the ability to jump from art to code and everything in between.
<!--<a href="https://tenderclaws.com/">Tender Claws</a>-->

I love crafting immersive, interactive experiences, finding new ways to tell stories that'll tug at your heartstrings and play games with your brain. I have tons of fun experimenting with stylized graphics, shaders, VFX, lighting, and polishing every pixel in engine!

Feel free to reach out to me at the email below!
