As a technical artist at <a href="https://tenderclaws.com">Tender Claws</a>, I designed narrative beats for this eye tracking experience, most notably the ghost subway scene. This included modeling, animating, and implementing interactive characters, environments, and VFX. I was also responsible for scripting the initial prototype and visuals of the main eye tracking mechanic.

Released March 2025.
