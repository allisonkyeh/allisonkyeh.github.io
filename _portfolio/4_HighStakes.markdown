A 2.5D turn-based puzzle game where mobs attempt to kill a tired vampire who wants to get home.

I co-produced and art directed this semester-long game project, leading a team of 15+ artists and programmers. My primary responsibilities included handling all environment art implementation and set dressing in Unity, as well as creating shaders, 2D/3D assets, and concept art.

The set dressing and look development process.

The mockup I made was informative to show the team how to approach this 2.5D style. An initial set dressing pass focused on grid readability and framing. For the second pass I focused on making the level become its own little immersive world.

Since our puzzle game had only 4 angles, I composed the dressing specifically to these 4 views. My main focuses were integrating the grid, filling out the background for the feel of an extended world, and creating a framed composition for each perspective.

For the framing I placed floating bushes and tilted trees to create a vignette effect that increased UI readability.

Some of the assets I modeled and textured to fit the style.
