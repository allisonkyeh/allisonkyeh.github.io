A semester-long study into the use of virtual reality for palliative care, where the aim is to lessen suffering and provide some recovery support to patients with serious conditions. These games have the potential to create positive experiences in medical care, whether through distraction therapy, physical therapy, or other soothing methods.

My first week-long project focused on creating a distraction therapy experience for pediatric patients coming in for a vaccine or other procedure, to alleviate their anxiety and making the process easier for them and hospital staff.

Patients would be able to magically create butterflies that fill up the garden space in the 30-60 second duration of getting a vaccine.
