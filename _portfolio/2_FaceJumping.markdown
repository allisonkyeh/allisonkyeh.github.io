As a technical artist at <a href="https://tenderclaws.com">Tender Claws</a>, I designed narrative beats for this eye tracking experience. This included modeling, rigging, animating, and implementing interactive characters, environments, and VFX. One particular scene I owned was the ghost subway scene where I implemented a train system with the ability to call, exit, or loop the train, and a bullet time effect when jumping from platform to train. I was also responsible for scripting the initial prototype and visuals of the main eye tracking mechanic.

Released March 2025.
