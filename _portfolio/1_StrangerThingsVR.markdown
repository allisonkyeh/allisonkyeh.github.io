As a technical artist at <a href="https://tenderclaws.com">Tender Claws</a>, I created, implemented, and optimized a wide variety of art in engine.<br>
This includes VFX, lighting, procedural creature animations, set dressing, environments and interactive props, and implementing story sequences.

Released February 2024.
